# cobwebplot-sensitivity
Draw so-called "cobweb plots" in sensitivity analysis: they are graphical tool to check the influence of input parameters on an output parameter.

Description
------------

Cobweb plots are useful to highlight the influence of several inputs onto an output.
For few high/low outputs, the input values yielding to each output are linked by a thread.
Repeated passage of the threads underline the "typical" values of some inputs parameters leading to such output.
One the other hand, when the threads spread randomly along all possible value for an input, it shows that this input is not influential.
